JIRA Prepend
============

JIRA Prepend provides a vim mapping for extracting the JIRA ticket number
from a git branch name for the purposes of prepending it to the start 
of a commit message. 

For example if you use JIRA and label all branches and
commit messages with the name of the JIRA ticket that you are working on
then JIRA Prepend makes it easy to extract the ticket number from the branch name 
and prepend it automatically when committing. 

This differs from
[mshirlaw/jira-prepend](https://github.com/mshirlaw/jira-prepend) only in that
it appends a colon ":" to the JIRA ticket number.

Usage
-----

JIRA Prepend provides a mapping to extract and paste a JIRA ticket number 
of the form `ABCD-1234` from a git branch name and automatically paste it at the
front of commit message.

The default mapping is `<leader>pp`. 

In normal mode this command will search for the pattern defined in 
`g:jira_prepend_ticket_pattern` which must be set in the user's `.vimrc` file.

Options
-------

To set the JIRA ticket search pattern to the string `ABCD` you may use following in 
your `.vimrc`. For example:
``` vim
let g:jira_prepend_ticket_pattern="ABCD"
```

To set an additional (optional) custom commit message i.e. `"Bugfix "` at the start of each commit 
message after the ticket number you can set `g:jira_prepend_custom_message` in your `.vimrc`. For example:
``` vim
let g:jira_prepend_custom_message="Bugfix "
```

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend 
using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). Assuming you 
have Vundle installed and configured, the following steps will install the plugin:

Add the following line to your `~/.vimrc` and then run `:PluginInstall` from within Vim:

``` vim
call vundle#begin()
" ...
Plugin 'mshirlaw/jira-prepend'
" ...
call vundle#end()
```
